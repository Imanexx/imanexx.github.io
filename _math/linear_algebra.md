# Proposition 1 of vector spaces  
1. Uniqueness of Zero - There is only one zero vector.  
2. $u + v = u + w$ then we have $v = w$.
3. Uniqueness of Negatives. Such that $v + w = 0$.

# Proposition 2 of vector spaces.  
Note: similar rules for multiplication.

# What about subspaces?  
Definition:  
A subset S of a vector space V is called a subspace of V if S is itself a vector space over the same field of scalars as V and under the same rules for addition and multiplication by scalars.  
In addition if there is at least one vector in V which is not contained in S, the subspace S is called a proper subspace of V.  

Subspace Theorem:  
1. The vector **0** in V also belongs to S.  
2. S is closed under vector addition.  $u + v = (u + v)$
3. S is closed under multiplication by scalars from $\mathbb{F}$.
