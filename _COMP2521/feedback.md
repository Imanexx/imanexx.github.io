**\*Note:** ```Responses``` counts how many students completed the feedback form. The total number of students is counted from Week 1 enrollments. However - It is common for a few students to drop out during the term which means that those students do not contribute to the end of term evaluation.

# **The best features of my teaching were:**
I have listed all the raw feedback for all classes I have ever taught.  
**Note:** `-` are my replies to said comments

> So much willing to help, willing to go overtime during labs too which is amazing.
- Having only 2 hours to mark makes it challenging to give useful feedback and clear up problems while staying on top of manual marking. I wonder if it would be better to have one TA that only handles marking and the other do code review?

> everything. I cannot fault David's teaching. He remained optimistic every week, encouraging student participation and explain concepts with great thorough. His classes were well–structured and planned out. He always responded to questions and I felt like he genuinely wanted us to improve and learn

> explains super clearly, very helpful as well

> I found the tutorial easy to follow and understand.

> David is very good at using picture to illustrate, and it helps me learn easier.

> tutorial explanations

> Best tutor I’ve had in COMP

> Engaging and helpful teaching. His use of diagrams also helps.

> Great Tutor, helped me alot with filling the gaps in my knowledge. Used very good examples when explaining concepts.

> Great teacher, kept encouraging people to participate. Explained content really well and answered all the questions

> Obviously put a lot of thought into tutorials and what students would benefit most from i.e. which points to go over based on their relevance in the course. Also gave a lot of feedback with marking and gave mark immediately which was very helpful.
- Thanks. Other tutors don't tell you your marks? Weird.

> David was honestly great, i really liked his teaching style too. He had a whiteboard and had a screen to write on which was cool.
- Definitely will prefer writing with a tablet for in person classes too now. It's a lot faster in some situations.

> Also just very encouraging of student participation and there were times he really went out of his way to make sure I understood the concepts when I wasn't sure.

> Lovely tutor. He would ask lots of questions to make sure you truely understand your work and if you are not, he will explain for you in details.

> Overall great instructor but his best feature was his ability to communicate concepts exceptionally well.

> He explained the tutorial questions in detail and made the concepts taught in lectures understandable in a practical context.

> Loved the use of the cards for the sorting algorithm, helps a lot. The way the graphs and other data structures were represented were very clear.

> David is by far the best tutor that I've had. He was super nice and taught content really well! You can tell David is a genius but he didn't make me feel stupid hahha Also I love that he made sure everyone's questions were answered and considered.

> David's tutorials were amazing, his visual and thorough explanations on the course content really help solidify the material introduced in lectures. He answered every question or query each student had with thorough and in–depth explanations. When marking labs he would go through each students work individually and take the time to understand their learning process to help  them identify and understand any improvements that could be made on their code and even take the time to challenge them to think on important concepts. Overall he was an amazing tutor and I don't think i would have made it through the course without him!

> – great in–depth explanations 
 – helpful attitude
 – clear insight into the topics

> Really prepared, clearly has experience teaching this type of content. Things were well explained, using appropriate illustrations. Pace was good.

> – Explained tough concepts in a clear and concise manner. Helped immensely with my understanding of the concepts.

> Was very helping 1 on 1 with explaining code and issues in code. When there was a bug, he often prompted the student to come up with a rough idea as to why the bug may be occurring, helping students conceptualise and understand coding to a higher degree. He explained concepts really well and is easy to talk to, generally always inviting and keen to help.

> –> Nice use of whiteboard and diagrams to help explain stuff

> –> Knowledgeable and engaging
> –> Actively encouraged student participation
> –> Intuitive demonstrations

> Going above and beyond to help students learn and deepen knowledge and understanding on content and in general. Supportive, encouraging and always motivating students. The way the teaching material is presented is very engaging. I personally slack off a lot (struggle to attend tutorials and just wanted things to get done quickly) but David has indirectly encouraged and challenged me to look at my work properly when David spent a good amount of time giving feedback on labs and suggesting alternative methods or techniques on how to solve a problem whilst being supportive and encouraging.

> David impressed me very much in the tutor course. He patiently helped us to sort out the lecture knowledge and establish an organic connection with us. He gave me more confidence in the course. 

> Very sociable, and had simple ways of explaining concepts that we needed to learn for the course. 

> David's teaching style is great, very easy to understand, I could just literally learn most of the course content from his tutorials, plus, he's very nice, he helped me out with lab questions and were very patient when I needed him to go over some topics again, thank you David! 

> Tried his best to visualise learning and explain everything properly for students. Also tried to engage the class to make sure they understood what he said.

> Variety of teaching modes (whiteboard, diagrams, playing cards to show sorting algorithms) 

> I really enjoyed his whiteboarding. David is an excellent tutor and it would be a pleasure to have him teach me again sometime in the future

> The modern teaching style and use of various tools such as the whiteboard, drawings, and playing cards to demonstrate algorithms was immensely helpful and engaging. The google drive material was really helpful to look back on during revision. Definitely the best tutor I've had at UNSW.

> His webcam/monitor filming situation was amazing, and he went through course material succinctly but also ensured that students understood what was going on

> Very professional.


> David was always helpful and friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. During the tutes he would also give interesting and illustrative explanations of concepts, like using cards to explain Quicksort.

> He was really enthusiastic and passionate about computing. I really liked that he always pushed us to optimise and improve every aspect of our coding, and that he provoked us to think about what the optimal approach was and what the flaws in our thinking were. Great tutor!

> Giving really good feedback when lab marking and posing challenging questions which made us think deeper about the topics and concepts. Explained concepts really well, and always super helpful when we had questions.

> Awsome tutor. Always gave it his 100%. Absolute legend. Very well prepared for online learning environment as well. Connected with students very well. Active in answering the chat. He didnt just give you the answer, he led you to it, and allowed you to answer it yourself with his guidance. 10/10

> – Great OBS setup
> – fun and engaging
> – uses online methods of teaching very well
> – encouraging and supportive to students
> – Has clear explanations
> – goes above and beyond to provide the best learning experience for students
> – approachable and creates a safe learning environment
> I wish I could redistribute my HECS directly to you.

> Gave very specific feedback, and pushed me harder to write even better code that more more efficient. Spent the time to chat and give personalised feedback and even used a dslr as his camera to demonstrate sorts with a deck of cards. <3

> David is a really passionate tutor. He always prepares thoroughly and is a great communicator/speaker. He is great at encouraging students to reconsider where they may have made mistakes and to try again, and had useful fun activities in the lab, whether it'd be shuffling cards to visualise sorting or showing us BFS on a maze. 

> Allowing the learning experience to be enjoyable and informative

> He was very clear and articulate in his teaching and knew the material well.

> One of the best tutors I've had at UNSW and he put a good amount of effort into each weeks tutes and into helping me individually during tutes and even answering my emails.

> – helped to accomodate learning of every student
> – went through material thoroughly
> – revise past material at start of tute as a rough catch up

> Super chill and also felt like he had a lot of insight into different areas of computer science which was really interesting to learn about.

> VERY good at explaining. Dedicated and learned a lot from him!

> You went very in–depth in interesting concepts and that was very captivating

> one of the best tutors i've ever had, his way of explaining concepts was amazing

> Having multiple modes of teaching in tutorials – whiteboard drawings, demonstrations with models, code follow–along etc, and each was chosen to be effective in explaining something and it really got across. The organisation/transitions between these methods were also seamless. Also making the time to answer many questions and follow up whether the answer has been understood.

> Very good setup for online learning, was very organised and encouraged participation a lot. Explained concepts really well, best comp tutor I've had

> Very chill but also knowledgable in this challenging course. I can understand simply by listening to his explanation

> Awesome tutorial sessions. He ran them very well and was engaging.

> Incredibly knowledgable about coding and great with helping you understand it better. So good that he supplemented and ended up substituting the lectures.

> Great and helpful explanations for concepts and when answering questions.

> Very great support given, approachable, helpful and gives good feedback. Responded to emails quickly with detailed explanations. Put effort into extra resources and tutorials. Genuinely cares for students and wants them to do well. Clearly knowledgable about content.

> Good clear explanations during tutorials and helpful during labs.

# **His teaching could be improved by:**
**Note:** I have removed all comments that were just praise again along the lines of "nothing, N/A, wouldn't change anything, not sure." etc etc.

> lab is too tough
- Unfortunately I do not post the labs. Sometimes I give feedback at the start of the term for what labs could be improved but for the most part they are set from Week 1.

> He never reply email
- I normally reply to all the student emails I get. Sorry that I missed yours. Sometimes I address emails during the tutorial if I think the reply can wait.

> Could possibly use the cards for showing searching algorithms as well?
- Interesting idea.

> David is too nice so I think people don't contribute in his class, but that's just the nature of most online classes I guess.

> Hard to say as I personally had a hard time waking up for and focusing on the tute.

> technical difficulties, which were not entirely his fault (stream crashing, video lagging, camera turning off)
- Yeah... Unfortunately the DSLR camera is a photography camera and not a video camera. Which means it will turn off every 30 minutes.

> I understand giving all the students feedback takes lots of time, but I wish there was more time to talk during the lab. Maybe give smaller sized classes?
- I wish there was more time too.

> Majority of students would be behind on lecs, so many explaining the concepts and how they worked in a basic sense rather than looking for students to help might be good
- Giving a high level overview of what we are doing in the lesson is a good idea.

> not teach online, really wish i had him in person in a lab :(
- It is quite unfortunate timing for both us (2020).

> Ummmm I know this is like contradicting the pros, but maybe just a smidge faster for marking. Everyone's very tired of waiting all day to get marked off for the week. But yeah i totally get that u have to spend the time to mark properly

> A very minor point, David could improve his bash so that he can help students more in this area if needed for the testing parts of some of the labs.
- You are right. Update: I understand bash better now to help :)

> The tutorials could be improved by maybe doing a bit more coding.
- Fair, I will put more coding examples in. I tend to focus more on the logic part of each problem. Once you understand the process of the thing we are trying to solve, the programming is the easier part. It's impossible to program if you don't know what's going on.

> Forcing students to turn on their mics to answer questions instead of typing in chat.
- You can type but the feedback will be quite limited for the time we have. I ask anywhere from 5-10 questions during a marking session depending on your code. Explaining your answers verbally is far quicker than typing the answers out. And it is faster to have a quick back and forth to clarify any misunderstandings.

> Getting the marking done a little quicker for question time. Always seemed to be busy during the labs, but would spend a long time with you eventually to make sure you got it
