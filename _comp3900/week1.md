## **Project:**
- Need to come up with some of your own requirements:
- Need 8 **Objectives**
- Needs new functionality or features:
  - Does not need to be _very_ advanced.
  - Create some novelties. So something that doesn't exist in opposing systems.

# Objectives
- "Features that contain a set of user stories"

## **Own Proposal**
1. Need to review related works similar to your project.
  - Only 2 or 3 (could do more but not much time to review all)
  - Only to serve as case study and background analysis.
> "From the two systems we have looked at, it is lacking *this* and *that*"
  - Try to come up with something similar
2. Fill in form:
  - Describe what the project is and give description
  - Come up with **Objectives** (ie user stories in terms of SCRUM)
3. In description:
  - Relate it to existing/similar systems.
  > Our project will be similar to _this_ but we want to do _that_



## **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**
User stories are similar to use cases.
Note: We will not be doing UML diagrams. Instead this is based on SCRUM methodology.

# User story
- High level description
> As a [WHO] I want to [WANT] so that [WHY]
- Create user stories for each objective in proposal.

Each Objective/Functionality is a:
- Set of user stories
- Written in the above format.

# Jira
All these User stories will be put into Jira-backlog. 

Each objective will be an "_epic_" and user stories will go under each epic. User stories will be assigned to members in the group. They will then implement the code.

For each user-story:
- List all acceptance criteria (This is how you know you are done with the task)
- Any tests that need to be conducted
This will form minimum viable product. Once completed you can update Jira status.

## **Advice**
- Try to work out technologies and languages before week 4.
- Ideally want to start programming around 16th June (Week 3) to prep for Demo on 27th June (Week 5).
- Have some progressive builds to show off
- Scrum retrospective:
  - What went well?
  - What did not go well?
  - What did you work on during the sprint?
  - What needs to change in the next sprint?
    - Eg. We did not have enough time to complete all the user-stories this sprint. We will fix that in the next sprint by giving more/less prority etc etc

## **Expectations about project:**
Test Coverage:
- Adhoc testing
- No need for automated tests
- We expect that you will have working software

Require Reasonable Performance
- Robust
- Secure
  - ie. not allowing anyone to access data they should not without permission
  - authentication measures

Performance and scalability
- We expect the project to work under "normal execution"
  - We do not test pushing it to the limits.
  - We won't be testing whether it crashes from too many users or breaks under weird executions.
- Data Should be reasonable:
  - You are allowed to create dummy data to propogate the system.
