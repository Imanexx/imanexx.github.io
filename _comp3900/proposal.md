The main ideas:
1. The system must enforce "Yavalath" board game ruleset on an online website
2. Users can create an account and log in
3. Users can play against friend/s using the same url (remote play)
4. User can play against AI/Computer

5. User can check their stats and reflect on gameplay
6. The system keeps track of (players elo)/game states/leaderboards/(hall of fame)

~~8. The game is played on an online website??~~

Novelties:
7. The system stores games/ The player can review replays of past games
9. Ability to play custom game-modes and extensions/rule changes.
- Custom board configurations (missing hex squares or larger board sizes)
- handicaps

# Dot point ideas

- Make an account
- Account users can view their stats
- Account users can see their rating on leaderboard against other players
- play weekly/daily challenges
- player can customize ruleset/board size
- the system can support online multiplayer... 3 players
- system records games and provides a replay system.
the system should have a game archive/search.
- The system should enforce ruleset and disallow illegal moves
- The website live updates against other player.

Novelty ideas:
- Additional ruleset mode that is different from classic. Ie powerups etc

## **Loose description of game:**
People want to play simple party games / board games online with their friends. Yavalath is a board game that has a similar ruleset to connect-4. 

Rules: Two players play on a hexagonal board. If you get 4 hexes in a row you win, but if you get 3 in a row you lose. 

We want to make a website that allows people to play against the computer or anyone online. It will also keep track of their games and stats compared to other people in the world.

# **Similar to the following:**
# [Online Yavalath](https://play.yavalath.com/)
Simple UI. Only supports 2 player ruleset.

- This website does not have a play again feature (must always pick a new url)
  - Want a better UI experience
- We want to add a 3 player ruleset.
- This website does not have players make an account
  - We want a login to record your player stats
  - Provide an online ranking system (elo)
  - Watch replays of your own game
- We want to add an option to verse the computer

# [Desktop version of Yavalath](http://cambolbro.com/games/yavalath/)
- This website lists the game rules and simple variants that we want to implement on the website
- Also include a desktop application to verse the computer
![desktopversion](/assets/images/comp3900/desktopversion.png)
- The computer takes 15 seconds to make any move. We want to improve the time that it takes to make a move

<br>
# [Another web version](https://www.yourturnmyturn.com/java/yavalath/index.php)
- Allows you to verse computer.
  - However is slow and not responsive
- UI covers up the screen making it unplayable
